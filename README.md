**Etymologyneering **  
*Learning through mental models  Python, LLMs and imagination.*

# **Etymologyneering**

**Etymologyneering** demonstrates how combining **mental-models thinking**, **Python**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through APIs can create **shortcuts in learning foundational knowledge** ‚Äî such as **languages, mathematics, and coding** ‚Äî saving years of traditional study.  
This project focuses on **English** as the language of exploration.

---

## **Concept**

Etymologyneering teaches English through **first principles** ‚Äî the **Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots** that act as the *atomic units* or **bedrock of meaning**.  
These roots are few, yet they generate thousands of words, creating a **compression of semantic space**.

Using **analogical thinking**, each PIE root behaves like a **latent feature in machine learning** ‚Äî though their nature differs:

- **Dimensionality Reduction** is mathematical and computed.  
- **PIE roots** are **genealogical and associative**.

---

## **Sources**

This work builds upon publicly available etymological data from:

- [**Etymonline.com**](https://www.etymonline.com)  
- [**Wiktionary.org**](https://www.wiktionary.org)

---

## **LLM Workflow**

The **OpenAI ChatGPT-4o API** generated structured entries with the following sections:

- **Greek Translation** ‚Äì (I‚Äôm Greek, but English unlocks vast access to science).  
- **Phonetic Spelling** ‚Äì for readers who can interpret it.  
- **Part of Speech** ‚Äì e.g., noun, verb, adjective.  
- **Etymology** ‚Äì historical origin and linguistic evolution.  
- **Nowadays Meaning** ‚Äì the modern sense.  
- **Connection to the PIE Root Stem**  
  - **Literal:** How physical senses evolved into abstract ideas.  
  - **Interplay:** How prefix, root, and suffix fuse into meaning.  
- **Example Sentences** ‚Äì three per entry.  
- **Conclusion** ‚Äì summarizes the evolution from root to modern meaning.  
- **One-Line Intuitive Link** ‚Äì compresses the story into a memorable shortcut.

## **Preventing LLM Hallucinations**

A **man-in-the-loop** review process ensured factual grounding and interpretive depth, supported by structured **guardrails**:

- **Missing PIE input for prefixes or stems can lead to hallucinations:** When the model isn‚Äôt provided with the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root of one or more components (e.g., in a word with two prefixes and one stem),
 it tends to invent or distort meanings for the missing parts.
- **Schema constraints:** fixed 9-section format with exact headings.  
- **Content separation:** no mixing of historical and modern meaning.  
- **Style rules:** concise sentences (‚â§ 20 words), academic tone.  
- **Evidence discipline:** expand abbreviations; trace prefixes to PIE.  
- **Reasoning scaffolds:** mandatory *Literal ‚Üí Metaphorical Bridge*; compact PIE ‚Üí Modern recap.  
- **Output consistency:** one-line summary ‚â§ 25 words.

## **Image Generation Pipeline**

Prompts for **text-to-image generation** were created using:

- **Meta-LLaMA-4-Scout-17b-16e-Instruct** via **Groq API** (the inference accelerator, not *Grok*).  
- Images generated by **Black-Forest-Labs / FLUX.1-Schnell** through the **Hugging Face API**.  

During the *review phase*, some images were updated directly in **ChatGPT-5** through the Chat UI.  
All prompts and captions were LLM-generated ‚Äî occasionally humorous ‚Äî and intentionally left unedited either **Meta-LLaMA-4-Scout-17b-16e-Instruct** or 
during the review by  **ChatGPT-5** through the Chat UI.  

---

## **Python Components**

- **BeautifulSoup** ‚Äì scraping etymological data.  
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì visualizing **clusters of derivative words** around each PIE stem.

---

## **How to Read the Volumes**

1. **Speed-read** each entry.  
2. Return to the **cluster diagram**.  
3. Reconnect each word‚Äôs meaning to its **root** and **prefix‚Äìstem interplay**.

Etymologyneering helps you *see how words are engineered* ‚Äî understanding the **mechanics of meaning**.

---

## **Why Clusters and Images?**

### **Clusters**

Neuroscience suggests the brain stores knowledge as **networks**, not lists.  
Each PIE root sits at the center of a **branching cluster**, mirroring this associative structure.  
This visual hierarchy reflects how ideas interconnect, making comprehension intuitive.

### **Images**

Based on **Dual-Coding Theory (Paivio)** ‚Äî the mind processes **verbal** and **visual** data through two linked systems.  
Combining both enhances **memory retention** and **understanding**, building stronger neural connections than words alone.

---

## **Collaboration Invitation**

If you know of **open etymological datasets or APIs** with accessible word stems and historical explanations (free of licensing restrictions), please share them as it would be ideal to buold an app to teach languages this way.

Future directions for me would be to expand to other domains of foundational knowledge ‚Äî such as **mathematics**, **logic**, and **code** ‚Äî to explore how mental models thinking,Python, LLMs and collaboration can accelerate studying in other domains.

- **PIE roots = first principles ‚Äî the atoms of meaning.**  
- **Compression of semantic space** parallels **dimensionality reduction.**  
- **Each root behaves like a latent feature in machine learning.**  
- **Man-in-the-loop guardrails ensure reliability.**  
- **Clusters mirror how the brain stores knowledge ‚Äî as networks, not lists.**  
- **Dual-coding theory proves that images strengthen memory and comprehension.**
